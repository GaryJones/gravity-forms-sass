# Gravity Forms Sass

I love the Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress, but never cared for the excessive stylesheets and complicated selectors it introduced. This project aims to offer styling for GForms using Sass and minimal selectors.


## What is Covered

All of the defualt and advanced fields, as well as the Gravity Forms Ready Classes. Included in this repository are several form exports that contain a vast array of fileds and options I created for testing.

* All form fields
* Required fields
* Multi part form
* Ready classes

Though a few aspects are still in early stages of dev ;)

## Contribute

If you want to help out, sweet! I just started this and there is a lot to do I am sure....


## TODO

Some parts of the styling still need to be addressed, 

1. Drop down and multiselect "enhanced UI"
2. Progress bar on multi select
3. Post Custom Fields - only tested "single line text" option
4. Check shipping various methods, only 1 allowed per form
5. More form settings, such as inline label placements
6. Organize structure, break up sections, import files from one
7. ...

Mostly this is a running list of what I intend to address
